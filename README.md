A tool to stymie the use of adversarial stylometry on oneself.

## What is Adversarial Stylometry?
According to [Brennan et al.](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~sa499/papers/adversarial_stylometry.pdf):
> The use of stylometry, authorship recognition through purely linguistic means, has contributed to literary, historical, and criminal investigation breakthroughs. Existing stylometry research assumes that authors have not attempted to disguise their linguistic writing style. We challenge this basic assumption of existingstylometry methodologies and present a new area of research: adversarial stylometry.
